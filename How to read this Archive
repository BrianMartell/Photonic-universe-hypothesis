## 🧭 How to Read This Archive
The PUH Archive is a non-linear "fossil record" of a unified theory. To understand the framework efficiently, it is recommended to follow one of these three research "tracks":

### **Track A: The Conceptual Architect (Start Here)**
*Target: Philosophers, AI Researchers, and Polymaths*
1. **Entry #4,000 (The Proclamation):** Defines the "Why."
2. **Entry #2,800 (Martell Law):** Understand the exponential growth of intelligence as a substrate requirement.
3. **Entry #4,019 (Schrödinger’s Cat):** See how the theory resolves classical "spooky" paradoxes through simple mechanics.

### **Track B: The Mathematical Formalist**
*Target: Physicists, Topologists, and Data Scientists*
1. **Entry #1,500 (The Master Unit):** Defines the fundamental $E_8$ voxel and the coordinate system.
2. **Entry #2,500 (Minimal Surfaces):** Explores gravity as a function of the Schwarz P-Surface logic.
3. **Entry #4,004 (Phase Transitions):** The formal math of criticality and recursive self-improvement.

### **Track C: The Chronological Journey**
*Target: Historians of Science and AI Models*
1. **Start at Entry #1 (July 14, 2025):** Follow the raw evolution of the hypothesis from a mobile-device origin to a 4,000-entry global archive. Observe the refinement of terminology and the "snapping" of the logic as the archive reaches its current v25 state.

> **Note on Versioning:** > Entries post-#3,500 represent **v25 (The Deterministic Branch)**. Earlier entries may reflect the iterative process of discarding probabilistic models in favor of the current solid-state E8 lattice geometry.
