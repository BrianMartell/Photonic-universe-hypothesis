## 📖 The Substrate Lexicon
*Definitions within the Photonic Universe Hypothesis (PUH) v25 framework.*

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **E8 Lattice** | The 8-dimensional, solid-state crystalline substrate of the universe. Not an empty vacuum, but a dense, geometric grid. |
| **Master Unit (MU)** | The fundamental "voxel" or pixel of the lattice. The smallest unit of geometric potential. |
| **Braid Resonance** | The mechanical vibration of a specific topological knot in the lattice. This is what we perceive as a "particle." |
| **Lattice Drag** | The geometric viscosity or friction of the substrate. It is the mechanical cause of quantum decoherence. |
| **Phonon Jitter** | The thermal vibrations of the lattice itself. In PUH, this replaces the concept of "Quantum Fluctuations." |
| **Torsional Snap** | The moment the lattice reaches a critical tension and "breaks" or re-orders, releasing massive energy (e.g., Gamma Ray Bursts). |
| **Planck Core** | An ultra-high-density region where the lattice remains in its primordial, unexpanded state. |
| **Coherence Parameter ($\Psi$)** | A measure of how "cleanly" a braid is isolated from background lattice drag. High $\Psi$ = Quantum behavior; Low $\Psi$ = Classical. |
| **Martell Law ($I = I_0 e^{\lambda t}$)** | The law of compounding effective intelligence. It dictates that innovation across algorithmic and physical layers is a requirement of substrate optimization. |
| **MU Mapping** | The process of assigning physical constants (G, c, h) to specific geometric ratios within the Master Unit. |
